# rainbow when it detects a spike of acceleration from the board's
# accelerometer.  Attach it to your sneakers for a quick and easy Python-powered
# 'circuit walker' sneaker project.

# This requires the neopixel.mpy be loaded on your board from:

# Configuration:
TAP_THRESHOLD_G     = 1.5      # Threshold for detecting a step and starting the
                               # animation.  This is a value in gravities (G's)
                               # so 1G = the normal force of gravity.  Typically
                               # you want a slightly higher value like 1.5 as
                               # the threshold so your foot lifting up against
                               # gravity triggers a step.

TAP_TIME_LIMIT_S    = 0.25     # Time window for step detection (in seconds).
                               # This configures the tap detection TIME_LIMIT
                               # register and tunes the tap detection.  If
                               # a spike of acceleration on any axis goes above
                               # TAP_THRESHOLD_G for _less_ than this time then
                               # a step is detected.  Decreasing this value
                               # makes the detection more sensitive to fast
                               # spikes.

STEP_FLASH_S        = 0.5      # Amount of time in seconds to flash/animates
                               # when a step is detected.

ANIMATION_FREQ_HZ   = 1.0      # Frequency for the sine wave of colors that
                               # occur during an animation.  Increase this to
                               # speed up the rainbow animation and decrease
                               # to slow down.
